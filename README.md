Created gambling game as part of homework assignment with the following instructions. 
Write a python program that simulates a simple dice gambling game.
The game is played as follows:
• Roll a six sided die.
• If you roll a 1, 2 or a 3, the game is over.
• If you roll a 4, 5, or 6, you win that many dollars ($4, $5, or $6), and then roll again.
• With each additional roll, you have the chance to win more money, or you might roll a gameending 1, 2, or 3, at which time the game is over and you keep whatever winnings you have
accumulated.
Use the randint() function from Python's Random module to get a die roll result.
